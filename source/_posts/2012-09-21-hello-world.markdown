Hello internets, this is my first post to you, users of the web.

I am Joe Woodward, a UK rubyist. My passion for programming was first developed in primary
school, I was given the oportunity to play with a [robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu0c40QibW4) that could
follow coordinates that were passed to it. It was a pretty basic form of
programming but I loved it.

As I grew older I developed a love for mathematics and electronics in
general. In October 2010 my brother introduced me to programming
through harvards open learning initiative program, always up for a
challenge, I threw myself in at the deep end. I completed David J.
Malan's [Intensive Introduction to Computer Science](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/intensive-introduction-computer-science)
before moving on to learn some Objective-C.
I had an iPhone 3G at the time and was really keen to build myself an
app, as time went by I became more and more interested in web apps and
stumbled upon ruby on rails. I knew this was where it was at, ruby on
rails was amazing, it seemed to have endless power. I wanted to embrace
that power for myself so took to learning ruby.
